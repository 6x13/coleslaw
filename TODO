"You can have it in any color as long as its black."

What views are supported? tag-based, reverse-chronological, by-month, single-post
Where is the data? git
How are update done? check for new commits every *interval*, possibly switch to commit hooks later
Post generation? Static
What is the post format? (markdown, plaintext, rst, etc, anything with a parser plugin!)
How are comments handled? They're not supported.
What about themes? Templates are themes. DUH.
Plugins? Injection support for HEAD and BODY. What about predicate-based injection?
How is it served? Hunchentoot, Lighttpd, S3, whomever!

TODO:
; after that, focus on markdown support, injections for code highlighting and latex

; doc themes and plugins
; fix plugins: s3
;; Incremental compile: only "touched" posts+tags+months. By-20 must be redone, of course.
;; ^^ Long as we're overhauling, maybe come up with a commithook scheme that runs main
;; and main becomes load-config, compile-theme, compile-blog?
;; support old URLs via use of post-aliases?
;;; plugins: analytics, logging/monitoring, crossposting, disqus
;;;; write a proper version of escape considering wild pathnames and valid URL issues
