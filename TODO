Historical Shifts
It's interesting to note two things.
1) Blogs went from static->dynamic->static being hip.
-- Some of this was motivated by technological fashion.
2) Comments went from being inessential->essential->inessential.
-- This latter point is largely related to shifts in social networks.
-- No more livejournal, RSS feeds don't promote communities.
-- Blogs are platforms designed for content syndication/publishing, not intelligent discourse.

TODO:
;;;; implement atom or RSS feed!
;;;; plugins: analytics, logging/monitoring, crossposting, disqus, pygments/gists
;; support old URLs via use of post-aliases?
;;;; write a proper version of escape considering wild pathnames and valid URL issues
