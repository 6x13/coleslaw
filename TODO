What about themes? Templates are themes. DUH.
Plugins? Injection support for HEAD and BODY. What about predicate-based injection?

BUGS:
; Slugs aren't unicode safe. See [reddit discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/yvh6g/coleslaw_jekylllike_static_blogware_in_500_lines/) and [mozilla code](https://github.com/mozilla/unicode-slugify/blob/master/slugify/__init__.py).

TODO:
; figure out how to make render-page support predicate based injections. -> 0.7
; doc themes and plugins, disqus and s3. -> 0.8
; unit tests -> 0.9
; Incremental compilation: only "touched" posts+tags+months and by-n. -> 1.0
;; possible plugins: analytics, logging/monitoring, crossposting
