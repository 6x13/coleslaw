Everything.

Ideas:
-- Replace cl-markdown with 3bmd down the line?
-- Use cl-inotify or similar for notifications instead of timers?

TODO:

;;;; STATIC
;;;; implement head-inject/body-inject/navigation!
;;;; implement start-coleslaw, stop-coleslaw!
;;;; implement render-site!!!
;;;; how many globals can we move into *storage* as keywords? ALL OF THEM!
;;;; -- What about generics?
;;;; implement atom feed. RSS too?
;;;; implement non-disqus comment support?
;;;; What do post update semantics look like? i.e. edit file to change tags.
;;; indices
;; what should it really look like, keeping in mind the API should be mostly
;; identical between the static and dynamic backend?
;; indexes should be id, type, title + posts. rewrite indices to use them.
;;; posts
;; post-url, improve escaping.

;;;; PLUGINS
;;;; add activate-plugin, deactivate-plugin, :active-plugins?
;;;; implement: analytics, crossposting, disqus, mathjax, pygments, recaptcha, s3
;;;; support input or output dirs being git repos + have git hooks?
;;; import
;; add comment handling ... (when comments ...)
;; support old URLs via use of post-aliases?

;;;; DYNAMIC
;;;; implement the whole damn backend!
;;;; make sure it has an admin interface!
;;;; -- spend two years trying to make it secure without HTTPS+SSL. fail.

;;;; rendering hooks (pygmentize, xposting) via :around/:before/:after methods
;; get run on rendered html before "storage"
;; xposting may be a rendering hook but may necessitate publishing hooks
;; again, these should be methods on a generic function

;;;; template hooks *ARE* pre-rendering-hooks. or methods on GFs.
;;;; they're methods on GFs you fool! work on the classes/constructors for post+indices
;;;; that's the only thing that makes sense. (eg 'disqus, 'mathjax)
;; run before the template is called to generate html or javascript includes
;; for a given template property (eg. comments, includes). they should probably be
;; methods on a generic function (eg. blog-comments, blog-includes)
