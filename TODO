BUGS:
; Slugs aren't unicode safe. See [reddit discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/yvh6g/coleslaw_jekylllike_static_blogware_in_500_lines/) and [mozilla code](https://github.com/mozilla/unicode-slugify/blob/master/slugify/__init__.py).

TODO:
; doc themes and plugins
; fix plugins: s3
;; Incremental compile: only "touched" posts+tags+months. By-20 must be redone, of course.
;;; plugins: analytics, logging/monitoring, crossposting, disqus
