Everything.

Ideas:
-- Replace cl-markdown with 3bmd down the line?
-- Use cl-inotify or similar for notifications instead of timers?
 -- plugins -> lastfm widget, analytics, rss/atom, disqus, akismet, etc.

;; TODO:
;; consider add-to-index/setf-index, create-index, create-post.
;; then ensure the indices API is okay and GET GOING.

;;;; DYNAMIC

;;;; STATIC
;;;; implement *output-dir*, render-site.
;;; posts
;; Make find-by-date, post-url not suck.

;;;; PLUGINS
;;;; implement disqus support
;;; import
;; add comment handling ... (when comments ...)
;; support old URLs via use of post-aliases?

;;;; rendering hooks (eg. :pygmentize, :xpost-lj?)
;; may need pre- and post- but for now stick to post-.
;; get run on rendered html before "storage"
;; xposting may be a rendering hook but may necessitate publishing hooks
;; again, these should be methods on a generic function

;;;; template hooks *ARE* pre-rendering-hooks. or methods on GFs.
;;;; they're methods on GFs you fool! work on the classes/constructors for post+indices
;;;; that's the only thing that makes sense. (eg 'disqus, 'mathjax)
;; run before the template is called to generate html or javascript includes
;; for a given template property (eg. comments, includes). they should probably be
;; methods on a generic function (eg. blog-comments, blog-includes)
