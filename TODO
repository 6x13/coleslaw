Everything.

THE OVERHAUL:
Where is the data? (mongodb, postgresql, flat files, lisp data persisted with cl-store or similar, etc)
What views are supported? (tag-based, reverse-chronological, single-post, etc)
How is the data edited? (web-admin-interface-p)
Who serves the data? (S3, Lisp server (hunchentoot/etc), System HTTPD (lighttpd/apache/etc)
How are comments handled? (Cloud service (disqus/etc), Stored and generated locally, disabled)

New Coleslaw: Screw choices!
"You can have it in any color as long as its black."

What views are supported? tag-based, reverse-chronological, single-post
Where is the data? git
How is the data edited? git status/inotify
Post generation? Static
What is the post format? (markdown, plaintext, rst, etc, anything with a parser plugin!)
How are comments handled? They're not supported.
What about themes? Templates are themes. DUH.
Plugins? Injection support for HEAD and BODY. What about predicate-based injection?
How is it served? Hunchentoot, Lighttpd, S3, whomever!

Historical Shifts
It's interesting to note two things.
1) Blogs went from static->dynamic->static being hip.
-- Some of this was motivated by technological fashion.
2) Comments went from being inessential->essential->inessential.
-- This latter point is largely related to shifts in social networks.
-- No more livejournal, RSS feeds don't promote communities.
-- Blogs are platforms designed for content syndication/publishing, not intelligent discourse.

TODO:
; implement read-post, render-by-month
; fix plugins: s3, wordpress
; implement plugins: atom, markdown, pygment/highlighting
;; Incremental compile: only "touched" posts+tags+months. By-20 must be redone, of course.
;; ^^ Long as we're overhauling, maybe come up with a commithook scheme that runs main
;; and main becomes load-config, compile-theme, compile-blog?
;; support old URLs via use of post-aliases?
;;; plugins: analytics, logging/monitoring, crossposting, disqus
;;;; write a proper version of escape considering wild pathnames and valid URL issues
