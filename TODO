How are comments handled? They're not supported.

TODO:
; blockers to use this for redlinernotes: rss/atom feed, markdown support
; after that, focus on injections for code highlighting and latex

; doc themes and plugins
; populate prev and next links
; implement plugins: atom, markdown, pygment/highlighting
; actually start using this for redlinernotes.com? Move over May-2007 to present.
; fix plugins: s3
;; Incremental compile: only "touched" posts+tags+months. By-20 must be redone, of course.
;; ^^ Long as we're overhauling, maybe come up with a commithook scheme that runs main
;; and main becomes load-config, compile-theme, compile-blog?
;; support old URLs via use of post-aliases?
;;; plugins: analytics, logging/monitoring, crossposting, disqus
;;;; write a proper version of escape considering wild pathnames and valid URL issues
