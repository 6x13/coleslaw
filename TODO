What about themes? Templates are themes. DUH.
Plugins? Injection support for HEAD and BODY. What about predicate-based injection?

BUGS:
; Generated directories aren't being removed properly.
; Post-receive hook on server doesn't appear to be executing. Invoking manually behaves as expected. What's going on here?
;; Suspect these issues are related. read-symlink doesn't return a directory pathname which causes cl-fad:delete-directory-and-files to blowup. Maybe stop using iolib for symlinks? What is portable?
;;; Propose replacing iolib based symlink code with something that uses DIRECTORY and/or TRUENAME.
; Slugs aren't unicode safe. See [reddit discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/yvh6g/coleslaw_jekylllike_static_blogware_in_500_lines/) and [mozilla code](https://github.com/mozilla/unicode-slugify/blob/master/slugify/__init__.py).

TODO:
; doc themes and plugins
; fix plugins: s3
;; Incremental compile: only "touched" posts+tags+months. By-20 must be redone, of course.
;;; plugins: analytics, logging/monitoring, crossposting, disqus
