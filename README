This software should be portable to any conforming Common Lisp implementation but this guide will assume SBCL is installed. Testing has also been done on CCL.
Server side setup:
* Clone or create the git repo for your blog.
* Install Lisp and Quicklisp.
* For now, git clone https://github.com/redline6561/coleslaw.git and add
           (push "/path/to/coleslaw/" asdf:*central-registry*) to your lisp's init file. (e.g. ~/.sbclrc for SBCL)
             -- You may need to (require 'asdf) in that file first or even create it! (Don't panic.)
      This is only temporarily necessary until coleslaw is in quicklisp.
* cp coleslaw/example.coleslawrc ~/.coleslawrc # and edit as necessary for your repo location, etc
* Edit your-blog/.git/hooks/post-receieve and insert:
#!/bin/sh
sbcl --eval "(progn (ql:quickload :coleslaw) (coleslaw:main) (sb-ext:quit))" # or (sb-ext:exit) on SBCL >= 1.0.57
* chmod +x your-blog/.git/hooks/post-receive
Now whenever you push a new commit to the server, coleslaw will update your blog automatically!
The only thing left to do is point a web server of your choice at the symlink /path/to/coleslaw/.curr
